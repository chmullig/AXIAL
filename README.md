AXIAL
=====

Project axial, since that's what github suggested.

Visualize the hackNY summer fellows.

Setup
=====
This is a Processing 1.5 project using the unfolding maps library. It's designed
to run via the included Makefile. It has only been used on OSX, but should be
reasonably cross platform if you make a few tweaks.

All required libraries should be included in /lib and /libNative.

It requires ffmpeg, some suitably acceptable version of java, Make, etc.

Data
====

It expects a geojson file from foursquare at `data/foursquare.geojson`. This is
generated by the parallel project-axial, https://github.com/chmullig/project-axial.

It will probably eventually expect images to be in data/images/, IRC metadata to
be in data/irc.json, twitter data to be in data/twitter.json, and more if we can
add it in time.

Caveats
=======
* This is using a slight patch to Unfolding as seen in
https://github.com/tillnagel/unfolding/pull/67

* It requires ffmpepg
